			Red Hat is committed to replacing problematic language in our code, documentation, and web properties. We are beginning with these four terms: master, slave, blacklist, and whitelist. Because of the enormity of this endeavor, these changes will be implemented gradually over several upcoming releases. For more details, see <a class="link" href="https://www.redhat.com/en/blog/making-open-source-more-inclusive-eradicating-problematic-language">our CTO Chris Wright’s message</a>.

			Migration Toolkit for Applications (MTA) 7.0 accelerates large-scale application modernization efforts across hybrid cloud environments on Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform (RHOCP). This solution provides insight throughout the adoption process, at both the portfolio and application levels: inventory, assess, analyze, and manage applications for faster migration to OpenShift Container Platform through the user interface (UI) and command-line interface (CLI).

				This section provides the new features and improvements of the Migration Toolkit for Applications (MTA) 7.1.0.
			</p><div class="formalpara"><p class="title"><strong>Support for analyzing applications managed with Gradle has been added to MTA</strong></p><p>
					In earlier releases of Migration Toolkit for Applications (MTA), you could use MTA to analyze Java applications managed only with Maven. With this update, MTA can also extract dependencies from Gradle projects. As a result, you can now analyze applications that use Gradle instead of Maven.
				</p></div><div class="admonition important"><div class="admonition_header">Important</div><div><p>
					Support for analyzing applications managed with Gradle is a Developer Preview feature only. Developer Preview features are not supported by Red Hat in any way and are not functionally complete or production-ready. Do not use Developer Preview features for production or business-critical workloads. Developer Preview features provide early access to upcoming product features in advance of their possible inclusion in a Red Hat product offering, enabling customers to test functionality and provide feedback during the development process. These features might not have any documentation, are subject to change or removal at any time, and testing is limited. Red Hat might provide ways to submit feedback on Developer Preview features without an associated SLA.
				</p></div></div><div class="formalpara"><p class="title"><strong>Support for analyzing .NET applications has been added to MTA</strong></p><p>
					In Migration Toolkit for Applications (MTA) 7.1.0, you can use MTA to analyze Windows-only .NET framework applications to aid migration from version 4.5 or later to multi-platform .NET 8.0 running on OpenShift Container platform. This feature is only available in the command-line interface (CLI).
				</p></div><div class="admonition important"><div class="admonition_header">Important</div><div><p>
					Support for analyzing .NET applications is a Developer Preview feature only. Developer Preview features are not supported by Red Hat in any way and are not functionally complete or production-ready. Do not use Developer Preview features for production or business-critical workloads. Developer Preview features provide early access to upcoming product features in advance of their possible inclusion in a Red Hat product offering, enabling customers to test functionality and provide feedback during the development process. These features might not have any documentation, are subject to change or removal at any time, and testing is limited. Red Hat might provide ways to submit feedback on Developer Preview features without an associated SLA.
				</p></div></div><div class="formalpara"><p class="title"><strong>Support for languages other than Java</strong></p><p>
					In Migration Toolkit for Applications (MTA) 7.1.0, you can use MTA to analyze .NET applications written in languages other than Java. To run analysis on .NET applications written in languages other than Java, add a custom rule set and do not specify a target language.
				</p></div><div class="admonition important"><div class="admonition_header">Important</div><div><p>
					Support for languages other than Java is a Developer Preview feature only. Developer Preview features are not supported by Red Hat in any way and are not functionally complete or production-ready. Do not use Developer Preview features for production or business-critical workloads. Developer Preview features provide early access to upcoming product features in advance of their possible inclusion in a Red Hat product offering, enabling customers to test functionality and provide feedback during the development process.

Red Hat might provide ways to submit feedback on Developer Preview features without an associated SLA.
				</p></div></div><div class="formalpara"><p class="title"><strong>Assessment and review statuses are now displayed in the MTA UI</strong></p><p>
					In earlier releases of Migration Toolkit for Applications (MTA), the status of the assessment and the review was only displayed for applications. With this update, the status of the archetype assessment and review processes is displayed in the MTA user interface (UI):
				</p></div><div class="itemizedlist"><ul class="itemizedlist" type="disc"><li class="listitem"><p class="simpara">
						The assessment statuses are the following:
					</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul class="itemizedlist" type="circle"><li class="listitem">
								Completed: All required assessments completed.
							</li><li class="listitem">
								InProgress: The assessment process is in progress.
							</li><li class="listitem">
								NotStarted: The assessment process has not been started.
							</li></ul></div></li><li class="listitem"><p class="simpara">
						The review statuses are the following:
					</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul class="itemizedlist" type="circle"><li class="listitem">
								Completed: A review exists.
							</li><li class="listitem">
								NotStarted: The review process has not been started.
							</li></ul></div></li></ul></div><div class="formalpara"><p class="title"><strong>New Insights feature has been added</strong></p><p>
					Tagging rules that earlier generated tags and showed the presence of technology also generate Insights now and show the location of code. While Insights do not impact the migration, they contain useful information about the technologies used in the application and their usage in the code. Insights do not have an effort and category assigned but might have a message and tag. You can view Insights in the Static report under the Insights tab.
				</p></div><div class="admonition important"><div class="admonition_header">Important</div><div><p>
					Insights is a Technology Preview feature only. Technology Preview features are not supported with Red Hat production service level agreements (SLAs) and might not be functionally complete. Red Hat does not recommend using them in production. These features provide early access to upcoming product features, enabling customers to test functionality and provide feedback during the development process.
				</p><p>
					For more information about the support scope of Red Hat Technology Preview features, see <a class="link" href="https://access.redhat.com/support/offerings/techpreview/">Technology Preview Features Support Scope</a>.
				</p></div></div><div class="formalpara"><p class="title"><strong>New MTA CLI options are available to select language providers when analyzing multi-language applications</strong></p><p>
					In earlier releases of Migration Toolkit for Applications (MTA), you could not select specific language providers to run separately for the analysis of a multi-language application. With this update, you can use the new <code class="literal">--provider</code> MTA command-line interface (CLI) option to explicitly set which language provider to run.
				</p></div><p>
				The following CLI options are also available with this update:
			</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul class="itemizedlist" type="disc"><li class="listitem">
						<code class="literal">--list-providers</code> to list language providers supported for the analysis.
					</li><li class="listitem">
						<code class="literal">--override-provider-settings</code> to override an existing supported language provider or to run your own unsupported provider.
					</li></ul></div><div class="admonition note"><div class="admonition_header">Note</div><div><p>
					You can now also configure supported language provider options in a provider’s configuration file.
				</p></div></div><div class="formalpara"><p class="title"><strong>A new Task Manager page is now available in the MTA UI</strong></p><p>
					In earlier releases of Migration Toolkit for Applications (MTA), tasks that were being performed and the queue of pending tasks were not displayed in the MTA user interface (UI). With this update, a new Task Manager page is available to view the following information about the tasks that are queued:
				</p></div><div class="itemizedlist"><ul class="itemizedlist" type="disc"><li class="listitem">
						<span class="strong strong"><strong>ID</strong></span>: The ID of the task.
					</li><li class="listitem">
						<span class="strong strong"><strong>Application</strong></span>: The application name associated with the task.
					</li><li class="listitem">
						<span class="strong strong"><strong>Status</strong></span>: The status of the task, for example, <span class="strong strong"><strong>Scheduled</strong></span>, <span class="strong strong"><strong>Pending</strong></span>, <span class="strong strong"><strong>In progress</strong></span>, <span class="strong strong"><strong>Succeeded</strong></span>, or <span class="strong strong"><strong>Failed</strong></span>.
					</li><li class="listitem">
						<span class="strong strong"><strong>Kind</strong></span>: The type of the task, for example, <span class="strong strong"><strong>analyzer</strong></span> or <span class="strong strong"><strong>discovery</strong></span>.
					</li><li class="listitem">
						<span class="strong strong"><strong>Priority</strong></span>: Priority of the task. The value is from zero to any positive integer. The higher the value in this column, the higher the priority of the task.
					</li><li class="listitem">
						<span class="strong strong"><strong>Preemption</strong></span>: It allows the scheduler to cancel a running task and free the resources for higher priority tasks. The values are <span class="strong strong"><strong>true</strong></span> or <span class="strong strong"><strong>false</strong></span>.
					</li><li class="listitem">
						<span class="strong strong"><strong>Created By</strong></span>: The name of the user who created the task.
					</li></ul></div><div class="formalpara"><p class="title"><strong>Multiple applications can now be selected to filter the applications list in Application Inventory</strong></p><p>
					In earlier releases of Migration Toolkit for Applications (MTA), you could select only one application to filter the results on the Application Inventory page. With this update, you can select multiple applications as a single filter to display the list of applications corresponding to this filter.
				</p></div><div class="formalpara"><p class="title"><strong>Support for providing a single report when analyzing multiple applications on the CLI</strong></p><p>
					mta-cli was designed to analyze a single application and produce a report about that application. With this update, you can use the <code class="literal">--bulk</code> option of the <code class="literal">analyze</code> command to analyze multiple applications, one <code class="literal">analyze</code> command per application, but with a common output file for all of the reports. As described in the CLI Guide, this results in mta-cli generating a single analysis report for all the applications, instead of generating a separate report for each application.
				</p></div><div class="admonition important"><div class="admonition_header">Important</div><div><p>
					Support for providing a single report when analyzing multiple applications on the CLI is a Developer Preview feature only. Developer Preview features are not supported by Red Hat in any way and are not functionally complete or production-ready. Do not use Developer Preview features for production or business-critical workloads. Developer Preview features provide early access to upcoming product features in advance of their possible inclusion in a Red Hat product offering, enabling customers to test functionality and provide feedback during the development process. These features might not have any documentation, are subject to change or removal at any time, and testing is limited. Red Hat might provide ways to submit feedback on Developer Preview features without an associated SLA.
				</p></div></div><div class="formalpara"><p class="title"><strong>New detailed reports generated during application analysis</strong></p><p>
					A new feature has been introduced that provides a more detailed analysis of your application. Two additional log reports, <code class="literal">issues.yaml</code> and <code class="literal">deps.yaml</code>, are now available for viewing and downloading. These reports contain details about unmatched rules.
				</p></div><p>
				To enable the system to generate these reports, select the <span class="strong strong"><strong>Enable enhanced analysis details</strong></span> checkbox in the <span class="strong strong"><strong>Advanced options</strong></span> window during application analysis.

				This section provides upgrade notes for the Migration Toolkit for Applications (MTA) 7.1.0.
			</p><div class="formalpara"><p class="title"><strong>PostgreSQL is migrated to version 15</strong></p><p>
					In the Migration Toolkit for Applications (MTA) 7.1.0, the <code class="literal">postgresql</code> container image has been migrated to a new <code class="literal">postgresql-15</code> version to be compatible with support. Note that this migration occurs during the upgrade to 7.1.0 and might take some time. The upgrade is considered to be completed when the status of the Tackle CR is Successful.
