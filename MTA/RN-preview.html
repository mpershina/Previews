				Migration toolkit for applications (MTA) version 8.0.1 provides the following fixed issues and other problems that have a significant impact.
			</p><p>
				In MTA 8.0.1 the performance of Java binary analysis has significantly improved. Before this change, when you analyzed Java binary applications, MTA incorrectly classified some open-source dependencies as internal dependencies, it was then decompiled and analyzed, that caused the analysis to take longer to complete. Now, the location of the Maven index file is passed to the Java provider to determine if an embedded dependency is open-source or internal. This fix resolved the two following issues:

							When you analyzed a binary, the performance degraded because MTA relied on Maven search. With this release, this issue is fixed by introducing the pre-generated Maven index that does not require connecting to an external index.

						</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul class="itemizedlist" type="disc"><li class="listitem"><p class="simpara">
									RAG solution: The Red Hat Developer Lightspeed for MTA uses Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) for context-based resolutions of issues in code. Developer Lightspeed improves the context shared with the LLM to generate more accurate suggestions to fix the issue in the code.
								</p><p class="simpara">
									The context is a combination of the source code, the issue description, and solved examples. Solved examples contain code changes you accepted for other migrations, code you manually modified, and a pattern of resolution for an issue that you can use in the future.

									Solution Server (Technology Preview): Solution Server is a component that allows Red Hat Developer Lightspeed for MTA to build a collective memory of code changes from all analysis performed in an organization.

								</p><p class="simpara">
									The Solution Server delivers two primary benefits to users:

								</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul class="itemizedlist" type="circle"><li class="listitem">
											Migration Success Metrics: It exposes detailed success metrics for each migration rule, derived from real-world usage data. These metrics can be used by IDEs or automation tools to present users with a “confidence level” or likelihood of Red Hat Developer Lightspeed for MTA successfully resolving a given migration issue or incident.
										</li></ul></div></li><li class="listitem">
									Agentic AI (Technology Preview): In the agent mode, Red Hat Developer Lightspeed for MTA makes iterative resolutions to issues in code. If you accept the suggested resolutions, Developer Lightspeed scans the code for diagnostic or linting issues that can be created due to the accepted solution and fixes those issues. NOTE: To obtain support for features in Red Hat Developer Lightspeed for MTA, you need an active Red Hat Advanced Developer Suite (RHADS) subscription.

							The Eclipse IDE plugin for migration toolkit for applications (MTA), which you could use to analyze the effort for migrating and modernizing your applications, is removed and is no longer supported. As an alternative, you can use the migration toolkit for applications extension for Visual Studio Code (VS Code).

							The <code class="literal">ANNOTATION</code> search location does not properly use Fully Qualified Names (FQNs) to match annotations. This leads to incorrect matches and false positives in analysis issues. For example, a rule that searches for annotations using the <code class="literal">javax.enterprise.inject.Produces</code> pattern might incorrectly match the occurrences of the <code class="literal">javax.ws.rs.Produces</code> annotation in the source code.

Consequently, only the values from the <code class="literal">values.yaml</code> file created after running the <code class="literal">mta-cli discover</code> command were used.

							Before this update, when you ran an application analysis for Gradle projects in containerless mode, migration toolkit for applications (MTA) command-line interface (CLI) did not detect Gradle dependencies. As a consequence, the analysis report did not list the dependencies and displayed an error message in the analysis logs instead. With this update, the issue is fixed. As a result, MTA CLI detects Gradle dependencies after the analysis is complete.

							Before this update, the <code class="literal">mta-cli discover</code> command only moved an application-level process with the process type explicitly defined to the <code class="literal">processes</code> block in the discovery manifest. Consequently, the discovery manifest did not list implicit application-level processes in the <code class="literal">processes</code> block. This resulted in the violation of the recommended clarity and proper configuration practices, especially if multiple process types were planned. With this update, <code class="literal">mta-cli discover</code> moves both implicit and explicit application-level process types to the <code class="literal">processes</code> block in the discovery manifest.
