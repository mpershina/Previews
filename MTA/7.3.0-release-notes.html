			Red Hat is committed to replacing problematic language in our code, documentation, and web properties. We are beginning with these four terms: master, slave, blacklist, and whitelist. Because of the enormity of this endeavor, these changes will be implemented gradually over several upcoming releases. For more details, see <a class="link" href="https://www.redhat.com/en/blog/making-open-source-more-inclusive-eradicating-problematic-language">our CTO Chris Wright’s message</a>.

			Migration Toolkit for Applications (MTA) 7.3 accelerates large-scale application modernization efforts across hybrid cloud environments on Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform (RHOCP). This solution provides insight throughout the adoption process, at both the portfolio and application levels: inventory, assess, analyze, and manage applications for faster migration to OpenShift Container Platform through the user interface (UI) and command-line interface (CLI).

				This section provides the new features and improvements of the Migration Toolkit for Applications (MTA) 7.3.0.
			</p><div class="formalpara"><p class="title"><strong>Asset generation is now available in MTA CLI</strong></p><p>
					Starting with MTA 7.3.0, you can run the <code class="literal">discover</code> and <code class="literal">generate</code> commands in the CLI:
				</p></div><div class="itemizedlist"><ul class="itemizedlist" type="disc"><li class="listitem">
						The <code class="literal">discover</code> command generates the discover manifest that preserves the platform and runtime configurations defined in the Cloud Foundry (CF) application manifest.
					</li><li class="listitem">
						The <code class="literal">generate</code> command uses the discover manifest to generate the deployment manifest in a Kubernetes-native format to prepare it for Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform deployments. You can also use the command to generate non-Kubernetes manifests such as a Dockerfile.
					</li></ul></div><div class="admonition important"><div class="admonition_header">Important</div><div><p>
					Asset generation is a Developer Preview feature only. Developer Preview features are not supported by Red Hat in any way and are not functionally complete or production-ready. Do not use Developer Preview features for production or business-critical workloads. Developer Preview features provide early access to upcoming product features in advance of their possible inclusion in a Red Hat product offering, enabling customers to test functionality and provide feedback during the development process. These features might not have any documentation, are subject to change or removal at any time, and testing is limited. Red Hat might provide ways to submit feedback on Developer Preview features without an associated SLA.

			</p><div class="formalpara"><p class="title"><strong>MTA now uses Red Hat Build of Keycloak for user authentication</strong></p><p>
					MTA 7.3.0 now uses <code class="literal">Red Hat Build of Keycloak (RHBK)</code> instance for user authentication and authorization. The MTA Operator manages the <code class="literal">RHBK</code> instance and configures a dedicated realm with necessary roles and permissions. For <code class="literal">RHBK</code>, the secret and the pod name has changed. The pod name for RHBK is changed to <code class="literal">rhbk-operator</code>.

				</p></div><div class="formalpara"><p class="title"><strong>Listing all languages in an application is now available</strong></p><p>
					In MTA 7.3.0, you can list all languages in an application by using the <code class="literal">--list-languages</code> flag in the CLI. The listed language that has no supported providers requires a custom rule set and the --<code class="literal">override-provider-settings</code> flag when you analyze the application.
				</p></div><div class="admonition important"><div class="admonition_header">Important</div><div><p>
					Listing all languages in an application is a Developer Preview feature only. Developer Preview features are not supported by Red Hat in any way and are not functionally complete or production-ready.

Developer Preview features provide early access to upcoming product features in advance of their possible inclusion in a Red Hat product offering, enabling customers to test functionality and provide feedback during the development process.

			</p><div class="formalpara"><p class="title"><strong>Support for Python and Node.js language providers is now available</strong></p><p>
					In addition to the Java and Go language providers, support for the Python and Node.js language providers is now available for the application analysis in MTA 7.3.0. As a result, you can now perform the following actions for these providers in the MTA user-interface (UI):
				</p></div><div class="itemizedlist"><ul class="itemizedlist" type="disc"><li class="listitem">
						Add custom migration targets.
					</li><li class="listitem">
						Run custom rules.
					</li></ul></div><div class="admonition important"><div class="admonition_header">Important</div><div><p>
					Support for Python and Node.js language providers is a Technology Preview feature only. Technology Preview features are not supported with Red Hat production service level agreements (SLAs) and might not be functionally complete. Red Hat does not recommend using them in production. These features provide early access to upcoming product features, enabling customers to test functionality and provide feedback during the development process.
				</p><p>

				This section provides the following bug fixes and resolves issues and other problems that have a significant impact on the Migration Toolkit for Applications (MTA) 7.3.0.
			</p><div class="formalpara"><p class="title"><strong>MTA CLI now excludes the <code class="literal">target</code> folder when analyzing compiled Java Maven projects</strong></p><p>
					Previously, for compiled Java Maven projects, the MTA CLI included incidents by analyzing the <code class="literal">target</code> folder. This generated different reports for Java Maven projects before and after running the <code class="literal">mvn-clean-package</code> command. This issue has been resolved in MTA 7.3.0. <a class="link" href="https://issues.redhat.com/browse/MTA-5078">(MTA-5078)</a>
				</p></div><div class="formalpara"><p class="title"><strong>Application credential update now triggers a new discovery task</strong></p><p>

					The Migration Toolkit for Applications (MTA) CLI not only analyzes source code but also transforms it to adopt a particular technology. To transform the code, MTA can use an external settings file, for example, to access the Maven repository. In such cases, this file must be mounted to a running container where the analysis engine will run.
